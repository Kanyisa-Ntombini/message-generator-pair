# Mixed Messages Project
## A Codecademy Pair Programming Project

```Javascript ```
###  **Project Overview**

The aim of this project, is to build a _message generator program_. Every time a user runs the program, they should get a new, randomized output. The project is taken in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make the program truly random, the message that it outputs is made up of at least three different pieces of data. This project takes what we know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to our liking.

***Sentences are not likely to make sense most of the time. :)***

Project Objectives:
    
* Build a message generator program using JavaScript
* Use Git version control
* Use command line
* Develop locally on your computer
